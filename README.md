## üî® Getting started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command
   in your terminal:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Before proceeding further using the command line interface (CLI), create a
   .env.local file in the root directory. You can do this by executing the
   following command:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

After creating the file, make sure to edit the `.env.local` file with the
appropriate values.

3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server on port 3000:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. And you should see the Lihai
   website.
